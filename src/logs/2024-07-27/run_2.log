Premises: Bob associated himself with green despite being covered head-to-toe in blue. Him being young and kind preceded him. Dave looks red to most people, with blue features. Gary fits the description of someone who is rough, red and blue. Someone who is round in shape and green in color is usually cold. Big, young people feel cold all the time. Blue kind people are almost always nice to others. A nice person who is always seen to be wearing green clothes will be rather big in size. Blue, young and round people are usually big.
Conclusion: Dave is not nice.

Premises: Bob associated himself with green despite being covered head-to-toe in blue. Him being young and kind preceded him. Dave looks red to most people, with blue features. Gary fits the description of someone who is rough, red and blue. Someone who is round in shape and green in color is usually cold. Big, young people feel cold all the time. Blue kind people are almost always nice to others. A nice person who is always seen to be wearing green clothes will be rather big in size. Blue, young and round people are usually big.
Conclusion: Dave is not nice.

Your final answer must be a one of True/False/Unknown, without additional information.
Premises: Dave is so young and darling he is kind to all the old people on the block. Even though he's a big dude, Eric is cold. Big Fred is cold but kind and always green. Gary fits the description of someone who is rough, red and blue. If someone is cold and young, you'll see that they are kind. Cold, green people have a habit of eating alot and looking quite round. As someone can be round and rough, they can also be nice and kind. When you meet someone with cold, rough skin and a round figure they will be nice. A rather round and green person will be red. When you meet someone who is round, red and green, they will also be young.
Conclusion: Fred is young.

Premises: Dave is so young and darling he is kind to all the old people on the block. Even though he's a big dude, Eric is cold. Big Fred is cold but kind and always green. Gary fits the description of someone who is rough, red and blue. If someone is cold and young, you'll see that they are kind. Cold, green people have a habit of eating alot and looking quite round. As someone can be round and rough, they can also be nice and kind. When you meet someone with cold, rough skin and a round figure they will be nice. A rather round and green person will be red. When you meet someone who is round, red and green, they will also be young.
Conclusion: Fred is young.

Premises: Bob became more and more round and nice and kind, but he couldn't stop being cold and big. In the snow sits Dave, crying from being cold. People think that Eric is round. This might be because he is young and blue. This Harry guy is red. He is also kind and yet cold. Big, kind people that are rough are known for being red. A green and blue colored person who is young will certainly be big. You will probably see that big, round, blue people are green, too. You will notice that a rough, nice, red individual will be young. A person with a round body will be feeling very cold and will be rough to handle. You will find most green,cold and blue people to be rough.
Conclusion: Harry is not young.

Premises: Bob is a man who is both round and rough. They always call him rough Dave. Fred is rough and is blue, but that's because he's big and round in a small and square world. A green, downhearted, and blue person with red cheeks is big. People who are round, blue and cold are usually nice. Someone big and rough in shape is always kind. Because of the person's young age they are feeling blue due to their big body size causing them to act in a slightly rough manner. Anybody with rough, kind and blue aspects will certainly be cold, too. Big people who at the same time are cold hearted and nice are a conundrum but they are also kind. When someone is rough like sandpaper and young like a tadpole they are always round.
Conclusion: Dave is rough.

Input: <s><|user|> Answer the following question in a thoughtful way. You can think step by step about the problem, if needed. Otherwise, you can provide a direct answer. In either case, end your response with 'Answer: ' followed by your final answer.
Your final answer must be a one of True/False/Unknown, without additional information.
Premises: Bob is a man who is both round and rough. They always call him rough Dave. Fred is rough and is blue, but that's because he's big and round in a small and square world. A green, downhearted, and blue person with red cheeks is big. People who are round, blue and cold are usually nice. Someone big and rough in shape is always kind. Because of the person's young age they are feeling blue due to their big body size causing them to act in a slightly rough manner. Anybody with rough, kind and blue aspects will certainly be cold, too. Big people who at the same time are cold hearted and nice are a conundrum but they are also kind. When someone is rough like sandpaper and young like a tadpole they are always round.
Conclusion: Dave is rough.

Premises: They always say that he is so nice and kind, that is Big Charlie.  But he is also round and blue. Dave who is considered nice was feeling rather rough today. People think that Eric is round. This might be because he is young and blue. In the snow sits Gary, crying from being cold. If a red person is cold and kind to others, they also tend to be blue. You'll always find a young, kind and red person to be a cold person, too. Being kind and young means that if they are also blue, they are always red. All nice people are young.
Conclusion: Eric is not round.

Premises: Alan always goes out of his way to show that he is kind to people. Eric is rough and cold, but he's young and will get over it. Gary is so big and round, it's hard to tell he is red, green and blue all at once. Harry is rough, but often feels blue. He is pretty young. A big round person is nice. I've found that people with rough skin tend to be really nice but they also often feel blue. Look for the blue and green people, they are kind and will give you directions if you're lost. When someone is kind and their cheeks flame red with embarrassment I know that they are young. A blue and red colored person that is young is also very cold.
Conclusion: Gary is blue.

Premises: Both green but also blue, Charlie is nice and kind while being cold. Dave is someone you could describe as young, round, cold, and blue. A person who is nice and green with envy is round. Big and round people can't help but be cold all of the time. Despite being kind cold people with red ears will still be big. Somebody whose descriptors are nice, big and kind will also fit a young descriptor. They found the ones that were round, blue, and green to be nice. If a person has round shape then they are also green and red.
Conclusion: Charlie is young.

Premises: Both green but also blue, Charlie is nice and kind while being cold. Dave is someone you could describe as young, round, cold, and blue. A person who is nice and green with envy is round. Big and round people can't help but be cold all of the time. Despite being kind cold people with red ears will still be big. Somebody whose descriptors are nice, big and kind will also fit a young descriptor. They found the ones that were round, blue, and green to be nice. If a person has round shape then they are also green and red.
Conclusion: Charlie is young.
Question: Is the previous conclusion True, False or Unknown given the premises?

Premises: Bob a big man for his young age. he has red hair and can be rough. You should meet Dave, he is big and rough on the football field but also very young in age. Eric gets red when he is mad and tends to act very cold. Gary, like all young people, is nice. A red colored and round person who is also young will be rather kind. Big and green people who feel cold are usually young in age. Someone who is not kind, will see red and be cold, which leads them to always feel blue. If you meet a kind green person with a round shape they will also be young. A person that is the color red will definitely be round shaped. Kind young people are also red and green.
Conclusion: Bob is not kind.

Premises: In the snow sits Dave, crying from being cold. Even though he's a big dude, Eric is cold. Fred is a round shaped but rough person, and is nice with the color blue. Gary always goes out of his way to show that he is kind to people. If you have a big and round shape then you are going to be young, too. Lucky for us, people that are round and red are kind to strangers. When someone feels blue and rough, they might be described as green. People who are big and kind and feel down and blue tend to have rough skin. A round and blue individual will also be a cold individual. A green person that is cold is often considered to be red. Young and nice people are ultimately cold.
Conclusion: Dave is not green.

Premises: In the snow sits Dave, crying from being cold. Even though he's a big dude, Eric is cold. Fred is a round shaped but rough person, and is nice with the color blue. Gary always goes out of his way to show that he is kind to people. If you have a big and round shape then you are going to be young, too. Lucky for us, people that are round and red are kind to strangers. When someone feels blue and rough, they might be described as green. People who are big and kind and feel down and blue tend to have rough skin. A round and blue individual will also be a cold individual. A green person that is cold is often considered to be red. Young and nice people are ultimately cold.
Conclusion: Dave is not green.
Question: Is the previous conclusion True, False or Unknown given the premises?

Premises: In the snow sits Charlie, crying from being cold. Dave was a complicated man. He was rough and red, yet nice and kind. He was as cold as he was blue. Gary is colored red and green. He is a nice young man and is also very big. If you meet a young, round person who is nice on the street, offer them your coat because they are cold. Most young and nice people will be kind. You will discover that green rough people are always red. If a person is red, kind, and nice then they must be round.
Conclusion: Dave is big.

He is a nice young man and is also very big. If you meet a young, round person who is nice on the street, offer them your coat because they are cold. Most young and nice people will be kind. You will discover that green rough people are always red. If a person is red, kind, and nice then they must be round.
Conclusion: Dave is big.

Premises: Fred fits the description of someone who is rough, red and blue. Gary is so big, he is often blue, but always kind. Even though Harry is big and rough, he is nice. Harry often is blue and green with envy. People who are rough are young. Red people who are also kind often turn out to be cold from standing outdoors too long. Young and rough green people, have no choice but to be red. Big people with round and somewhat red faces will have rough skin. People that are red and blue and green at the same time have a reason to be cold. Green eyed people are often nice, but when they are also round about the middle they are most certainly kind.
Conclusion: Bob is not round.

Premises: Alan wears all blue. Green eyed Bob is kind and nice. Since he is also big and round with rough skin he often turns red in the sun. Gary is interestingly colored red and blue, and is also very kind. People who are rough around the edges, nice, and a bit blue are young. A round shaped and rough person will be blue as well. If smeone has a blue and green color, then they are young and probably kind. Being big and kind like a gentle giant can make anyone blue. A rather round and green person will be red. A person that is both nice and young will also be cold.
Conclusion: Bob is not cold.

Input: <s><|user|> Answer the following question in a thoughtful way. You can think step by step about the problem, if needed. Otherwise, you can provide a direct answer. In either case, end your response with 'Answer: ' followed by your final answer.
Your final answer must be a one of True/False/Unknown, without additional information.
Premises: Alan wears all blue. Green eyed Bob is kind and nice. Since he is also big and round with rough skin he often turns red in the sun. Gary is interestingly colored red and blue, and is also very kind. People who are rough around the edges, nice, and a bit blue are young. A round shaped and rough person will be blue as well. If smeone has a blue and green color, then they are young and probably kind. Being big and kind like a gentle giant can make anyone blue. A rather round and green person will be red. A person that is both nice and young will also be cold.
Conclusion: Bob is not cold.

Premises: Dave is a red fellow who habitually looks blue. He's often cold. Eric is a very kind, green but sometimes cold person. Young Fred is so nice even though he always feels cold.  He loves to wear blue and green clothes. I've found that a person who is green from lack of experience and nice even when they are feeling blue often has a red complexion. If you come across someone with rough skin and a big and round shape, you'll see that they are also a big green. A rough and kind person is big. A quite nice person will certainly be red. I've noticed that red, cold people who are kind have the trait of rough skin. A cold natured but kind person will certainly be red. People who are nice and rough are looked at as kind.
Conclusion: Dave is not kind.

Premises: In the snow sits Alan, crying from being cold. They always call him rough Bob. Dave is a person both green and big. Big, red Gary is quite kind. Someone with round, red, and kind traits also will be green. Cold, red people are generally kind and big. A young, red person will certainly be cold. A person that is the color red will definitely be round shaped. A big, young aged person that is green will be round shaped. If someone is kind, green, and round sized, then they are typically nice people. If you meet somebody who is green, big and red you'll notice they are also blue.
Conclusion: Bob is not young.

Premises: Charlie is big and dresses in blue. Eric often feels a bit blue and tends to run on the cold side while also being very nice and red. Gary was round, nice, and because he was cold, he looked rather blue. Young people who wear red lipstick are certainly kind. Though they were big and nice, they simultaneously were rough and aloof and seemed cold to others. Nice and blue people have to be big as well. A big, nice, blue person is likely to be young.
Conclusion: Gary is red.

Premises: Charlie is big and dresses in blue. Eric often feels a bit blue and tends to run on the cold side while also being very nice and red. Gary was round, nice, and because he was cold, he looked rather blue. Young people who wear red lipstick are certainly kind. Though they were big and nice, they simultaneously were rough and aloof and seemed cold to others. Nice and blue people have to be big as well. A big, nice, blue person is likely to be young.
Conclusion: Gary is red.

Premises: Young Alan got into a fight that left him with red sores on his face. They always call him rough Charlie. Fred is round shaped and green colored. If you met Gary you would find him nice, blue, cold and quite big. It's a fact that young people are red people. When someone is young they can be nice and kind, but green in society. People that feel green are cold to people that try to help them. Round green people usually feel blue. You will discover that green rough people are always red. A person with the qualities of being cold and being red will also be a person that is green. When a person is blue, cold, and nice, they are also pretty young too.
Conclusion: Alan is not round.

Premises: Young Alan got into a fight that left him with red sores on his face. They always call him rough Charlie. Fred is round shaped and green colored. If you met Gary you would find him nice, blue, cold and quite big. It's a fact that young people are red people. When someone is young they can be nice and kind, but green in society. People that feel green are cold to people that try to help them. Round green people usually feel blue. You will discover that green rough people are always red. A person with the qualities of being cold and being red will also be a person that is green. When a person is blue, cold, and nice, they are also pretty young too.

Premises: Charlie is young, rough and green, but he turns blue when he is cold like anyone else. Because Eric gets cold easily he tends to appear round from bundling up. Fred was born only a few years ago so he is young. Harry is so young and darling he is kind to all the old people on the block. If people are cold they are often red. Interestingly, cold and rough people are kind. Young, kind people have the trait of being cold and are also very nice to interact with. If a person is red, kind, and nice then they must be round. Some kind person that is round a blue will get embarrassed and turn red. People who are nice and rough are looked at as kind.
Conclusion: Charlie is not nice.

Premises: In the snow sits Bob, crying from being cold. Because Fred gets cold easily he tends to appear round from bundling up. Harry is a young, round fellow who is red and green in color. He is also cold. Young people that are blue will still be kind because they are rough to the touch. A young person with a kind heart and big sized body will be rough around the edges. Being a young, round and kind individual means that you are also a blue individual. If you find someone who is kind, big in personality and looks a little green, then you can bet that they are cold. People who are cold and and red are also young and kind.
Conclusion: Harry is not young.

Input: <s><|user|> Answer the following question in a thoughtful way. You can think step by step about the problem, if needed. Otherwise, you can provide a direct answer. In either case, end your response with 'Answer: ' followed by your final answer.
Your final answer must be a one of True/False/Unknown, without additional information.
Premises: Young Bob got into a fight that left him with red sores on his face. Fred looks big and is kind with red hair and green shoes. Gary is both young and fairly round in size. Upon meeting Harry, you'll notice he's green and kind. Someone who has a a young round face is often rough around the edges. A young person with rough red skin is downhearted and blue. A red colored person will be rough textured and will be blue. Everyone who manages to be both rough and round are also kind. As someone can be round and rough, they can also be nice and kind. If a person is young and very kind then they will be rather big. Nice people are cold people.
Conclusion: Gary is round.

Premises: In the snow sits Charlie, crying from being cold. Dave is a rough man with a big heart who has red hair and a nice smile. Eric is a nice, kind young man.  Eric keeps a sweater with him because he is always cold. Harry was born only a few years ago so he is young. I've found that a person who is green from lack of experience and nice even when they are feeling blue often has a red complexion. Don't be surprised to hear that all nice, kind folks are in fact rough. When you know someone who is young and green you can count on them being nice to everyone. There are so many rough, young people and for some reason they are all big too. People who are young and green are also kind. People who are nice, big, and also rough, are considered red. Those who are round and cold are young.
Conclusion: Dave is green.

Premises: Alan is cold with rough red skin. Alan is big but is also kind. Eric is rough but very kind, he is also red in color and young in age. Gary ate some rotten meat and now feels green.

I know anyone I meet who is big, nice, and round will be young. Someone with rough, big traits will be a green person, as well. If a person is young and very kind then they will be rather big. An individual who is big and nice is also green.
Conclusion: Alan is green.
